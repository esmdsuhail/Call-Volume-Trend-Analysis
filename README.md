### Project description 
This project is based on customer experience (CX) analytics focusing on the inbound dataset spanning 23 days a month, featuring agent details, queue time, call duration, and status. The CX team is the backbone for customer feedback analysis and provides data-driven insights to manage variable tasks in an organization. The project aims to understand call volume trends and derive insights and the ultimate goal is to optimize advertising and enhance customer engagement through valuable insights derived from call volume analysis.


### Data source 
The Primary dataset used was Call_Volume_Trend_Analysis_Project.csv after some data cleaning and preparing the required data I analyzed it according to the project tasks

### Data analysis

1. Determine the average duration of all incoming calls received by agents. This should be calculated for each time bucket

   ![T_1](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis/assets/142283402/72bb287f-5f88-4baa-82a6-737d7dcdd305)

   The total average call duration for the received calls is 197 sec. and the chart shows the average call duration that agents spend according to the time buckets which is from 9 AM to 9 PM


2.	Visualize the total number of calls received. This should be represented as a graph or chart showing the number of calls against time.

    The total calls from 9 AM to 9 PM of 23 days of the January month  from the dataset is 117988 and out of them answered and transferred are 83585 and abandoned 34403


3.	What is the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to reduce the abandon rate to 10%?

  	From the chart, we can say that to reduce the abandoned rate to 10% each time bucket should increase the manpower as planned by calculating the call duration on total calls and each      agent spent in the month and also per day which is 253279sec & 11012sec


4.	Propose a manpower plan for each time bucket throughout the night, keeping the maximum abandon rate at 10%.

    For the night shift (from 9 PM to 9 AM) manpower which is said for every 100 calls 30 were received at night using this, we calculated total calls 1385 and the duration of calls         272284sec. This gives us the req. agents and their distribution

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze and derive insights from call volume data, providing valuable information for improving customer experience and operational efficiency. The proposed plans offer practical solutions for reducing abandoned rates and allocating manpower which ultimately contributes to enhancing customer satisfaction at ABC Insurance company
